I'm a Psychology graduate student who, from an interest in quantitative research methodologies, started some studies in the Statistics. As these studies progressed I ended up arousing my interest and getting closer and closer to the area of DataScience and its applications.

- With psychology, I was able to develop some of my main *Soft skills*, as: **Intellectual curiosity, Critical thinking, Communication** and **Teamwork**. 🧠💭🔎 

 - As for the *Hard skills*, I'm looking to develop myself in: **Statistics, R Language, Python, Data Visualization, Machine Learning** and **MySQL**. 📈🐍🤖
